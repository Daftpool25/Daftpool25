I'm 24 years old, currently I know javascript, HTML, css, bootstrap and Sass. Regarding libraries and frameworks, I specialize in React.js on the frontend side and Express on the backend. Thanks to platforms like OpenBootcamp and FreeCodeCamp I've been able to learn these technologies, as well as SQL and non-SQL databases (mongoDB, Firebase). 

I was born in Venezuela, but I emigrated at the age of 18, when I became independent. I've had jobs in various areas of commerce, gastronomy, etc. In 2019 I moved to Argentina. Since high school I was programming apps in Java with Android Studio and Ecipse, but then I had to pause my interest in programming until now that I've successfully resumed it.
